# Master SQL
This repository contains simple to complex SQL queries that I have written to solve problems (focused on data analysis). It also contains personal notes I took while learning the topics. The queries are written for PostgreSQL database.

The qeuestion in this repo are part of the [Data science course from udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)

## How to use

The [parch-and-posey.sql](parch-and-posey.sql) file contains SQL script to create the database and tables and to fill the tables with mock data. The rest of the files contain the queries to solve challeges. The files are named according to the topic of the problem. For example, the [join.sql](join.sql) file contains queries to solve challenges related to joins.
